## Lingusitic rules for telling time🐹:
### English
In English, the basic format for telling time is as follows:

"It's" + "hour" + "minutes" + "am/pm"

In this format, "hour" represents the current hour, and "minutes" correspond to the current number of minutes. "Am" is used for time from midnight until noon, indicating the morning hours, while "pm" is used for time from noon until midnight, denoting the afternoon and evening.

The time is typically presented in the 12-hour clock format.


Special cases:

Midnight: When the clock strikes 12:00 at midnight, it's referred to as "twelve midnight" rather than 12:00 am.

Noon: When the clock strikes 12:00 at noon, it's called "twelve noon" instead of 12:00 pm.

Quarter Past: When the minute count is 15, the expression "quarter past" is used instead of specifying the exact number of minutes past the hour.

Quarter To: When the minute count is 45, the phrase "quarter to" is used, along with the subsequent hour, to indicate that the time is nearing the next hour.

Half Past: When the minute count is 30, "half past" is used, followed by the current hour, to indicate the halfway point in the hour.

### Chinese
In Chinese, the fundamental structure for conveying the time is as follows:

"Now" + "is" + "morning (6:00-11:59)" / "noon(12:00-12:59)" / "afternoon (1:00-5:59)" / "dusk (6:00-6:59)" / "evening (7:00-24:59)" / "before dawn (1:00-5:59)" + "hours" + "minutes"


Special cases:

When the minute part is 0, the minutes are omitted, and only the hour part is mentioned.


### Korean
In Korean, the format structure is as follows (in Korean, verb always appear at the end of a sentence):

"Now" + "morning (6:00-11:59)" / "afternoon (12:00-17:59)" / "evening (18:00-23:59)" + "hour" + "minutes" + "is"


Special cases:

When the minute part is 0, the minutes are omitted, and only the hour part is mentioned.
