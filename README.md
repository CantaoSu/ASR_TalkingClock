# SPEAKING CLOCK

## Lingusitic rules of telling times:
In English, the basic format for expressing time follows the pattern:
"It's" + "hour" + "minutes" + "am/pm."
In this format, "hour" represents the current hour, and "minutes" correspond to the current number of minutes. "Am" is used for times from midnight until noon, indicating the morning hours, while "pm" is used for times from noon until midnight, denoting the afternoon and evening.
The time is typically presented in the 12-hour clock format.

Special cases:
Midnight: When the clock strikes 12:00 at midnight, it's referred to as "twelve midnight" rather than 12:00 am.

Noon: When the clock strikes 12:00 at noon, it's called "twelve noon" instead of 12:00 pm.
Quarter Past: When the minute count is 15, the expression "quarter past" is used instead of specifying the exact number of minutes past the hour.
Quarter To: When the minute count is 45, the phrase "quarter to" is used, along with the subsequent hour, to indicate that the time is nearing the next hour.
Half Past: When the minute count is 30, "half past" is used, followed by the current hour, to indicate the halfway point in the hour.
These rules encompass the fundamental principles of telling time in English.


In Chinese, the fundamental structure for conveying the time is as follows:
"Now" + "is" + "morning (6:00-11:59)" / "noontime (12:00-12:59)" / "afternoon (1:00-5:59)" / "sunset (6:00-6:59)" / "evening (7:00-24:59)" / "before dawn (1:00-5:59)" + "hours" + "minutes."

Special scenarios:
When the time duration equals 0, the minutes are omitted, and only the hour is mentioned.



In Korean, the formant structure is as follows:
"Now" + "is" + "morning (6:00-11:59)" / "afternoon (12:00-17:59)" / "evening (18:00-23:59)" + "hour" + "minutes" + "it is."
